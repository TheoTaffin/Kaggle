# Kaggle
start date : 22/01/2020

## Purpose
I created this repo to store kaggle competition solutions that I could come up with. I hope that
being a part of those competitions will allow me to develop my capacity to analyse a data
science problem and come up with solutions given the data and the expected results.

I know there are a lot of project available, but they often come up directly with the solution,
and the project themselves are often very specific or oriented to train a particular skill, or a
 particular model.

I prefer Kaggle competitions to them because it's more complete in some ways, since there's a
lot more to figure out, whether it's about how you can explore the data or what model you have
to build to be the more efficient.
